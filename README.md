# Customer-Churn-Analysis-on-Banking-Dataset
Banking is one of those traditional industries that has gone through a steady transformation over the decades, yet many banks today with a sizeable customer base hoping to gain a competitive edge have not tapped into the vast amounts of data they have, especially in solving one of the most acknowledged problems â€“ customer churn. This project targets to retain as many customers as possible in the bank and to know what leads a client towards the decision to leave the bank on the basis of the predictors like credit-score, age, gender, balance, estimated salary etc.
The repository comprises the data file, code file and the project report. The project was done during the Summer of 2022, under the guidance of Prof. Biswabrata Pradhan, SQC and OR unit, ISI Kolkata.
